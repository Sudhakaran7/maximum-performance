There are n engineers numbered from 1 to n and two arrays: speed and efficiency, where speed[i] and efficiency[i] represent the speed and efficiency for the i-th engineer 
respectively. Return the maximum performance of a team composed of at most k engineers, since the answer can be a huge number, return this modulo 10^9 + 7.
The performance of a team is the sum of their engineers' speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among their engineers.

Input Description:
First line contains the value of n and k. (1<n,k<1000).
Second line contains, n value of speed as integers in array.
Third line contains, n value of efficiency as intergers in array.

Output Description:
Return the maximum performance of a team composed of at most k engineers.

Sample Input:
6 2
2 10 3 1 5 8
5 4 3 9 7 2

Sample Output:
60

Explanation:
We have the maximum performance of the team by selecting engineer 2 (with speed=10 and efficiency=4) 
and engineer 5 (with speed=5 and efficiency=7). That is, performance = (10 + 5) * min(4, 7) = 60.
